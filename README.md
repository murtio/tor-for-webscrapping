### Summary
Some API's block scrapping attempts after few requests. Some websites do that as well. Users are left with two option: 1) pay for the API provider, or 2) change their IP address. Now changing IP address can be done in many ways, one of them is using the Tor project. In this repo we give an introduction to the Tor project and a demo for using it in web scrapping. It should be noticed that the demo can be extended into adding a Controller to automate changing the Tor  relays network and hence IP, however, our code doesn't go into that far.

### Materials
1. ODT presentation introduction to the Tor project
